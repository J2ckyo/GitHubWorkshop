# Fork, Clone, Branch, Commit, PR

Welcome to our Git and GitHub workshop! This README will guide you through a hands-on activity where you'll learn how to fork, clone, create branches, commit changes, and make pull requests. Follow these steps to participate in the group activity.

## Start of Group Activity

### 1. Fork and Clone
- **Fork the Repository**: Go to the main repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
- **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone [URL of your fork]`.

### 2. Create Feature Branch
- **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch in your local repository by running `git branch add-YourName` (replace 'YourName' with your actual name).
- **Switch to Your Branch**: Change to your new branch with `git checkout add-YourName`.

### 3. Add Name and Commit
- **Edit userList.txt**: Open `userList.txt` and add your name to the file.
- **Stage Your Changes**: Stage your changes for commit with `git add userList.txt`.
- **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your staged changes using `git commit -m "Add [YourName]"`.

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request
- **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to your GitHub fork with `git push origin add-YourName`.
- **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your fork on GitHub and create a new pull request to the main branch of the original repository.

### 5. Review and Merge Pull Requests
- **Review Process**: A designated reviewer will check your pull request.
- **Merging**: Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch of the original repository.

### 6. Syncing Forks (Optional)
- **Stay Updated**: Optionally, learn how to sync your fork with the original repository to stay updated with the latest changes.
